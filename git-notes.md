# 9/24:
 We started using GIT to track files, first the professor explained the concept of *"commit"*, in short words\
one *commit* = one snapshop. GIT stores the changes betweem snapshots, not the whole files.\
The great feature about GIT is that you can easily restore the whole project to a previous snapshot and then\
get back to the latest snapshot.\
Some importants commands:\
git init # initialize repo: creates .git\
git status # VERY important, use it all the TIME\
git add #add new edits to staging area\
More useful commands can be found [here](http://cecileane.github.io/computingtools/pages/notes0927.html)

when we create a git repository by git init it creates a new .git folder, if you want to make it a benign folder again you just have to remove thta folder
if you want to remove that igt folder you need "rm -f".
Git push upload the commits to the cloud, git pulls does the opposite

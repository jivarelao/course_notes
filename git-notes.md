9/24: We started using GIT to track files, first the professor explained the concept of "commit", in short wods\
one commit = one snapshop. GIT stores the changes betweem snapshots, not the whole files.\
The great feature about GIT is that you can easily restore the whole project to a previous snapshot and then\
get back to the latest snapshot.
